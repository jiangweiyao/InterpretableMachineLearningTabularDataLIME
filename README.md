# Interpretable Machine Learning for Tabular Data

This project holds a series of notebooks demonstrating using the LIME package for interpretable machine learning. The models are generated on the UCI Heart Diseases data.

### Part 1
The first notebook focuses on data cleaning, data exploring, and building a simple decision tree model.

### Part 2
The second notebook builds a GLM (statistical) model and uses LIME to explain the predictions.

### Part 3
The third notebook builds a Random Forest (machine learning) model and uses LIME to explain the predictions.
